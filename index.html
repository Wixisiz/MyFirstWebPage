        <!--150 word paragraph about my love of webnovels-->
        <p>Webnovels is how I can say reading is my hobby without lying. 
            When I was in my freshman year of high school, I found a great interest in webnovels. 
            Webnovels were simply novels with hundreds of short chapters written by all kinds of people online.
            I feel like, unlike other books, Web novels have a sense of freedom in their writing for both the 
            readers and the readers. Before webnovels, the only books I have read were ones at libraries or given 
            by teachers, but the main difference between the books I have read before and web novels is that web 
            novels were simply the desires and wants of the people who wrote them rather than writing for a publisher 
            or for an educational purpose, web novels were written with only one purpose of giving the reader satisfaction. 
            Most importantly anyone can write a web novel and publish it. When I first downloaded an app for webnovels, 
            I exposed myself to what I believed to be hundreds of libraries of books in just my phone.
